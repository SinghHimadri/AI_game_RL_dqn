# Build AI for Atari Ping Pong üèì
#### Implemented deep reinforcement learning (deep Q-learning) applied to play a Cart Pole game, Mountain Car using Keras and OpenAI gym.

An exploration of how to use OpenAI Gym to teach an AI to play games, from basic tasks like Mountain Car, to Atari Pong.

#### Cart Pole:


#### Mountain Car:


#### Atari Pong:


## Inspiration
I took one Machine Learning class in school, but even after that, I never really branched out in my ML projects beyond plugging in some SciKitLearn packages and crossing my fingers. So, for this project, I wanted to learn something way out of my comfort zone, even if it meant that I couldn't create something completely original. So, I spent a day learning about reinforcement learning and Deep Q Learning, and taught an AI to play some games (with a lot of help). üôèüèæ

## Installation
1. Follow the instructions for installing OpenAI Gym [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs). You may need to install `cmake` first.
2. Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
3. Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
4. Install Keras: `pip install keras`

## Usage
#### To run the mountain car example (this takes around 20 minutes to train)
    $ python mountain-car.py

#### To run the mountain car example (this takes 3-5 days to train)
    $ python pingpong.py

#### To see results:
The [scores](/2_ml/scores/score_logger.py) folder has some tools to plot the results of an exercise, and can be customized further.
